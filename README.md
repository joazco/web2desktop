# Web2Desktop

**Web2Desktop** transforms any already built website or web application into a native desktop application for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

It provides a lightweight Electron-based shell, a secure native bridge, and a simple workflow to package web builds as real desktop software — without modifying existing web code.

---

## ✨ Why Web2Desktop?

Building desktop apps from web projects often feels heavier than it should be.

web2desktop focuses on:

- ✅ simplicity over configuration
- ✅ drop-in usage (HTML, CSS, JS builds)
- ✅ security by default
- ✅ open source & framework-agnostic

No frontend framework lock-in.  
No complex bundler setup.  
Just your web build → desktop app.

## 🎯 Who is this for?
